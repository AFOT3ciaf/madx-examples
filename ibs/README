IBS Module

1) LHC proton run
./madx < ibs.mad > ibs.out

2) LHC proton ions
./madx < ibs_ion.mad > ibs_ion.out

3) CLIC damping ring with quadrupole tilt errors 
./madx < ibs_clic_dr.mad > ibs_clic_dr.out

4) LHC protons injection with crossing angles 
./madx < ibs.lhcinjection.mad > ibs.lhcinjection.out

5) LHC protons top energy with crossing angles 
./madx < ibs.lhctopenergy.crossingangles.mad > ibs.lhctopenergy.crossingangles.out

Comments V3.02.03 19.02.2006 by FS:
- Input ibs_clic_dr.mad had several input errors but results did not change 
after a fix.
- In Routine twsint variable "alam" was used before being initialized, again
no effect on the results.
