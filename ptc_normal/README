Example of NormalForm analysis with PTC in MAD-X.

A table is printed that gives:
-dispersion
-tunes
-first and second order chromaticity
-anharmonicities
-Hamiltonian terms(Resonances) up to fourth order.

The run command is:

madxp < test_5frs.madx >! test_5frs.out

A sodd analysis is done within MAD-X as well (output in
distort_1_H_end). This analytical treatment of SODD agrees 
perfectly with the PTC NormalForm analysis. Compare the
Hamiltonian terms in "distort_1_H_end" and "test_5frs.out".
