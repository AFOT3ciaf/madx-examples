chrom: launch twiss with chrom option. rembeber to include the desired varaibles in the twiss table with the select command


jacobian: Matching routine. It is a simple implementation of the newton methods, the jacobian of the system is calculated and the linear problem is solved. 
A QR or LQ  decomposition is performed when the system is over or under-determined. Several strategies are implemented for dealing with the constrained variables:

strategy=1, when a variable exceeds a limit it is reseted to the limit
strategy=2, no actual matching, the jacobian is printed
strategy=3, when a variable exceeds a limit it is excluded from the set of variables unless the number of variables equals the constraint otherwise it is reseted.

It is possible to apply a transformation to set of variables before each matching assing to the parameters "cool" and "random" the followin values:

cool   cooling factor. Apply a transformation to the variables
        before perform the matching. The transformation is:
        if "balance" >=0
         newval=(1-cool)*oldval+cool*((1-balance)*maxval+balance*minval)
        else
         newval=(1-cool)*oldval+cool*opt

        "opt" is the optimal values specified in the vary command.

random apply a random  transformation to the variables
        newval= (1+ random *( rand() - 0.5) ) * oldval

repeat=n the matching routine n times


slope   arguments: 1,0,-1. Allows the variable only to increase (1), decreas(-1), both (0)
opt     Optimal value use with "cool" option, balance has to be set -1
