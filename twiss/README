Short run with five fodo cells:

Date: 15.09.2005

Run command:
madx < fv9.madx >! fv9.out
 
Special tasks:

a.) Twiss parameters calculated at the center of the element.
b.) The internal table "my_table" is used as a twiss table ergo this name
    is used in the "select" command.
c.) The components of the one-turn map, at the location of each element, here
    just re11, re12, re13, re14, are written to the twiss output file. 
d.) The cumulative sectormaps are written at the center of the drifts to the 
    sectorfile = "my_sectorfile".

run output:       fv9.out
twiss output:     twiss_fv9
sectormap output: my_sectorfile

Comment V2.00: sector map has been corrected for closed orbit error
Comment V3.00.00: 1) Results are now closer again to those of V2.10 and earlier.
                  For unknown reasons old executable do not reproduce the
                  bad results.
                  2) Results are different since the center option was incorrect
                  before when a closed orbit was present.

Date: 15.09.2005

Run command:
madx < fv9_matrix.madx > ! fv9_matrix.out

Special task:

Introduce a matched arbitrary matrix at position "partstart" of the above example
"fv9.madx". The effect of this matrix can be found in the output file 
"fv9_matrix.out" by inspecting the TWISS output before and after the introduction 
of the element.

Comment V2.00: The phase advance in the beta0 block has been changed to be in units
               of 2 *pi (request Oliver Bruening).
Comment V3.00.00: All okay here!
Comment V3.02.03: the command "value" must have a comma now!
------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Long run of Lep:

Date: 15.09.2005

Run command:
madx < lep.madx > ! lep.out

Special tasks:

a.) Twiss parameters calculated at the center of the element.
b.) Write out of one-turn matrix at every element
c.) Notice: "couple" is no longer a valid attribute since TWISS in MAD-X
    calculates in coupled mode by default.

run output:   lep.out
twiss output: twiss_lep

Comment V2.00: The "illegal" couple flag. V2.00 turned out to be corrupted!!!
Comment V3.00.00: All okay here!
------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Test of chromatic functions:

Date: 15.09.2005

Courtesy of Jean-Yves Hemery

Run command:
madx < jvh_twiss.madx > ! jvh_twiss.out

run output:   jvh_twiss.out
twiss output: twissleirinj.txt

Comment V2.00: The initilisation of Wy=0 works now properly, before 
               initialised to a "circular" value.
Comment V3.00.00: All okay here! Twiss select works now.
