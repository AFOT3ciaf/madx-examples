PTC_TWISS calculates Ripken-style Twiss parameters (similar to 
TWISS3-command in MAD8). PTC_TWISS Examples 1-4 in the directories 
"Example1", ..., "Example4" show matching task between a ring and 
a transferline.

The task is formulated by the following way:
      At the linking point of the ring with a transferline, 
      twiss values resulted from the tracking around the ring 
      are needed to put to the transferline as initial conditions.  

The input files for the ring lattice (ring.seq, fv9.opt, fv9.seq) 
and for the transferline lattice (line.seq, ebsy.madx,edl1.madx, 
eff1.madx, eirt1.madx) are located in the directories 
"ring_lattice" and "line_lattice", respectively.

Four small examples shows 4 approaches for initial values input:
  1) as Twiss parameters from the BETA0 block (named as "TWSSip");
  2) as Twiss parameters given as arguments of PTC_TWISS-command;
  3) as transfer matrix from the map table by PTC_NORMAL-command;
  4) as transfer matrix  given as arguments of PTC_TWISS-command;

To Run an Example enter to the corresponding directory and type:

../madxp < exampleN.madx [> exampleN.out]

Other special output files:
twiss_madx_ring    -  Twiss parameters around the ring as the TFS 
                      table generated by the TWISS command;
twiss_ptc_ring     -  Twiss parameters around the ring as the TFS 
                      table generated by the PTC_TWISS command;
ring_matrix_at_end -  The one-turn map (matrix) table of the ring 
                      generated by the PTC_TWISS command and 
                      printed by the WRITE-command.
twiss_ptc_line     -  Twiss (Ripken-style) values along the line 
                      generated by the PTC_TWISS command.
fort.18, fort.20   -  debug files with a map and PTC parameters;
