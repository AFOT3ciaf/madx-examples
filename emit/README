                        EMIT examples for MAD-X
                        ********************************

A standard usage of EMIT is given in the LEP directory.

The example in the ALBA directory illustrates a limitation
of the EMIT module. This module assumes nearly constant
lattice functions inside elements. This leads to wrong
equilibrium emittances in certain machines like the
Spanish light source ALBA. The solution is trivial. The
bending magnets need to be sliced to properly account
for the variation of the lattice functions.
