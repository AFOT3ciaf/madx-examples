Example 1:

run with 

./madx < convert_example_rhic.madx >! convert_example_rhic.out 

the output is in 

convert_example_rhic.out

and it creates the files fc.2, fc.3.aux and fc.34

these have been renamed as fc.2_ref_rhic, fc.3.aux_ref_rhic 
and fc.34_ref_rhic respectively.

All the example does is create the RHIC sequence and then outputs it to 
sixtrack format with the split flag set.

Comment 3.02.03: removed the non-existing optics command
----------------------------------------------------------------------------

Example 2:

run with 

./madx < convert_example_lhc.madx >! convert_example_lhc.out 

the output is in 

convert_example_lhc.out

and it creates the files:
fc.2
fc.3
fc.3.aux
fc.8
fc.16
fc.34

which have been renamed with a _ref_lhc suffix (for reference).

The example loads in the LHC v6.2 thin sequence, it misaligns the 
quads, adds field errors to various magnets corrects and finally twisses. 
The resulting sequence is then output as SixTrack input (with the 
reference radius of the magnets set to 0.017).
