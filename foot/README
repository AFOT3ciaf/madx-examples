Run command:

madx < footprint.mad > ! footprint.out

Creates a footprint for head-on + parasitic collisions at IP1+5 
of lhc.6.503 (4.00.3 version without individual BV flag); both 
lhcb1 (for tracking) and lhcb2 (to define the beam-beam elements, 
i.e. weak-strong) are used; there are flags to select head-on, 
left, and right parasitic separately at all IPs.
The bunch spacing can be given in nanosec and automatically creates
the beam-beam interaction points at the correct positions.
It is important to set the correct BEAM parameters, i.e. number
of particles, emittances, bunch length, energy.

The output file "footprint" can be viewed with gnuplot:

HG  4.6.02

V4.00.03: lhc.6.503 MAD-X 4.00.3 version without individual BV flag

V3.00.00: Switch to LHC V6.5 with proper slicing (new makethin HB).
          Dynap (FS) had been corrupted by a coworker by removing 
          changes (npart = 2*stored_track_start->curr;) of (FZ) in 
          madxn.c. All fine now.

V3.01.01: while and macro call terminated with a ';'
          makethin gives messages about inconsistent slicing but okay.

V3:02:03: Horizontal Tunes wrong due to error in DYNAP module.
