example1.mad :

uses the LHC lattice version
V6.50x and exercises different types of the orbit correction
procedures. The screen output of such a run can be found
in example1.out.
Other files are output files generated by running MAD-X.
Two reports describing the algorithms and procedures are
found in algo.ps and ext.ps
Both reports contain further detailed examples.




example2.mad:

corrects both beams of the LHC simultaneously using
the TWORING option. The orbit distortions are caused
by misalignment of shared quadrupoles.
The correction is restricted to the use of shared
orbit correctors to demonstrate the feature.

 


example3.mad:

corrects the orbit taken from a file (orbps.in)
generated in an earlier MADX run or from an online
measurement. The model for the correction is
computed in the example.
The output orbit file (m.tab) could be used as
input for further corrections.
