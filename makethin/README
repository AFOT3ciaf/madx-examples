The short example may be run with:

madx < fivecell.madx >&! fivecell.out

The example output is stored in fivecell.out

The example takes a small fivecell sequence and slices all quads
to five slices. The sequence is then saved as

fivecell_thin.seq

---------------------------------------------------------------

The long example may be run with:

madx < lhc_example.madx >&! lhc_example.out

The example output is stored in lhc_example.out

The example loads the thick version of the LHC sequence
and slices the main magnets, writes the thin sequence
and calculates the twiss for the thin sequence.


asp1b.madX  is a short example which shows how dipole ends
     can be described using thin lenses, with tracking and plotting.
     It writes several files, so you may want to copy
	 the madX-examples/makethin to a temporary directory which you
	can make by
mkdir /tmp/$LOGNAME/
  and run the example there
cd /tmp/$LOGNAME/ ; madx < asp1b.madX
  The output files have names b_*

Use dipedge to describe fringe fields.
Example:
  instead of
MyBendWithFringe : SBEND, L:=len, ANGLE:=ang, e1:=ang+b, hgap:=gap, fint:=finol;
  use dipedge + simple bend
MyFringe : dipedge, h:=ang/len, e1:=ang+b, fint:=finol, hgap:=gap;
MyBend   : SBEND, L:=len, ANGLE:ang;


---------------------------------------------------------------

Starting from madX version 3, makethin works with standard selection
for elements by class, range and pattern.


Hints for selection:
--------------------

The selection works on the current sequence and a good
practice is to have a
  use, sequence=MySequence;
before the selection statements for that sequence.

Prefer selection strings without quotes, i.e.
  class=mbx
rather than
  class="MBX"
to avoid lower / upper case mismatch.
