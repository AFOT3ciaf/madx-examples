Example 2:
   Output in  normalized coordinates 
   Input in standard coordinates; 6 particles;
   icase=4; closed_orbit; turns=1000; no=1; 
   Output in normalized coordinates at beginning of the ring (i.e., at START)

Initial files for running the example 1 are
    Readme                - this file
    fv9_2.madx            - madX input data file
    fv9.opt               - madX input data file
    fv9.seq               - madX input data file
    Makefile_2            - command file 
    *.plt                 - scripts for running GNUPLOT

The example can be run with commands ("Makefile_2"):
=============================================================
# Run Example No.2 with "madxp" 
#     using the input "fv9_2.madx" and output "fv9_2.out" 
madxp < fv9_2.madx > fv9_2.out

# Plot with GNUPLOT4.0
gnuplot make_plots2.plt

# clean temp files
rm empty.ps
==============================================================


The resuling files are

    fv9_2.out  - the output text-file of madx
 
    track.obs0001.p000* - output data-table for the n-th particle 
                          at observation point0001 (i.e., at START)
    fv9_2_START.ps      - phase spaces at START plotted by MAD-X
    obs1_XX1.eps        - X-X' phase spaces plotted by GNUPLOT
    obs1_YY1.eps        - Y-Y' phase spaces plotted by GNUPLOT 

    PDF_2 - directory with pdf-images derived from the above postscript files.
