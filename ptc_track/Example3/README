Example 3:   One can compare the plots with different order of Normal Forms 
             by changing the parameter <norm_no>
             
   Input in standard coordinates; 4 particles;
   icase=4; closed_orbit; turns=1000; norm_no=1,4,8,12,16; 
   Output in normalized coordinates at beginning of the ring (i.e., at START)

Initial files for running the example 1 are
    Readme                - this file
    fv9_3.madx            - madX input data file
    fv9.opt               - madX input data file
    fv9.seq               - madX input data file
    Makefile_3            - command file 
    *.plt                 - scripts for running GNUPLOT

The example can be run with commands ("Makefile_3"):
=============================================================
# Run Example No. 3 with "madxdev" 
#     using the input "fv9_3.madx" and output "fv9_3.out" 
madxp < fv9_3.madx > fv9_3.out

# Plot with GNUPLOT4.0
gnuplot make_plots3.plt

# clean temp files
rm empty.ps
==============================================================

The resuling files are

    fv9_3.out  - the output text-file of madx
 
    track.obs0001.p000* - output data-table for the n-th particle 
                          at observation point0001 (i.e., at START)
    fv9_3_START.ps      - phase spaces at START
    obs1_XX1.eps        - X-X' phase spaces plotted by GNUPLOT
    obs1_YY1.eps        - Y-Y' phase spaces plotted by GNUPLOT 


    <no_1>...<no_16>    - directories with results for different values 
                          of parameter  <norm_no>. 
                          pdf-images derived from the above postscript files 
                          are also posted there. 

    fv9_1_START_no1_4_8_12_16.ps(pdf) - 
                          results for different <norm_no> collected in one file.
