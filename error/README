Example 1:

The input file: example1.mad assigns different
types of alignment and field errors to a simplified
lattice. Error tables are printed for different
types of elements of the lattice.


Example 2:

For a simplified lattice relative field errors are
assigned and time memory corrections for the normal 
components are computed and added using a third
order polynominal parametrization defined in the
hcoeffn option.


Example 2:

The field and alignment errors for 1232 bending and
392 quadrupole magnets are read from a TFS file,
produced with ESAVE or any other program.
Generic READTABLE and SETERR are used.
