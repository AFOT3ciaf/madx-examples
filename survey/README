TEST OF SURVEY IN MADX
----------------------

- file dipring : contains only H-dipoles. SURVEY is run with psi0=0.1 in order
               to test the closure and angle computation.

                execution : ./madx < dipring > dipring.out

- file vline : contains a vertical bend followed by a 90 degree bend. This
               makes it possible to test TILT, PHI and PSI

                execution : ./madx < vline > vline.out


- LHC test : calls a sequence v6.4 made in april 2003 without any K.

   execution for the average ring : ./madx < lhcsrvR0 > lhcsrvR0.out

      The result contains the element coordinates for the average LHC 
      ring wich is closed within some E-10m. 

   execution for beam1 : ./madx < lhcsrvB1 > lhcsrvB1.out
   execution for beam2 : ./madx < lhcsrvB2 > lhcsrvB2.out

     For beam1 and beam2 the closure  is less accurate (2E-5) because of the
     accuracy of the positioning of the dipoles in the LHC database.

- job_ti8_globaltilt.madx : calls a TI8 sequence TI8.seq

   test of GLOBALTILT output to take into account the tilt of the element 

   the tilt of TED.87765 is adjusted to give GLOBALTILT 0
   (with the numerical precision this gives 2.391420395e-12)   (FT 17.02.05)
